## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Changed the three `get_regression_` functions to not include the `lm` call
based on feedback from CRAN
* Added datasets relevant to sampling-based inference
* Added testing


## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04.5 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

* This is a new release.

## Reverse dependencies

This is a new release, so there are no reverse dependencies.
